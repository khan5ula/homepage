### [The site is live here](https://www.kristianhannula.com)

This is my personal homepage. Initially I created this site with React without a framework, but soon realized that serving static files and routing the pages dynamically did not work quite well with React. Also, the site was very javascript-heavy which didn't feel right for such a simple site. I decided to migrate the project to Astro which was a perfect choice for my use-case.

The site is built with Astro + React + Tailwind CSS.
