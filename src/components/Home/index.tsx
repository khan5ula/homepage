    <p>
      My name is Kristian Hannula. Thanks for visiting my website! Although this
      site is definitely not as cool as the{' '}
      <span className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:decoration-1">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_(manga)">DBZ</a>
      </span>{' '}
      fanpage I made when I was a kid (which is unfortunately lost in time).

      Right now it's quite empty in here... I'm planning on adding more stuff in
      the future. In the meantime, you can stalk my GitHub account or connect
      with me on LinkedIn.
    </p>
