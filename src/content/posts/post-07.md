I just installed this quality-of-life extension that I found useful, and it might be worth trying if you've experienced similar issues. Since I didn't want to create an account to the marketplace, I decided to recommend it here.

So, when writing markdown files with VS Code, every time I wrap a piece of text to backticks, I get six ticks instead of three. It's a small thing, but as a recurring problem it tends to get really annoying.

[Markdown Wrap Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GermainItalic.markdown-wrap-code) allows you to wrap a selected piece of text within three backticks with a keyboard shortcut (which is ctrl + e by default, but it's customizable).

At this point it only has a few installs, but it simply does what it promises.
