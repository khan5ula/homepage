## Hi, I'm Kristian

... a fledgling programmer, student in information processing science, enthustiast in Open-Source Software, and a dad.

I tinker with this website as a hobby and post stuff related to my interests.

After years of pointing-and-clicking on computers, I finally got a hang on coding during my late 20's. Turned out I couldn't get enough of it. I've been writing a little bit of code pretty much daily ever since.

I created my first website with some website builder as a kid. It was a kickass [DBZ](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_(manga)>) fan website with background music, cursor animations and everything. It forever bugs me that I lost it when I got concerned with other matters during my teenager years.

Well, I'll try to keep this site clean of animated annoyances. On second thought, perhaps we should bring those back and get rid of the [real annoyances](https://www.deceptive.design/types/obstruction).
