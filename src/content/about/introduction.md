## Hi!

I tinker with this website as a hobby and write about things I'm interested in. Mostly tech.

I created my first website with some website builder as a kid. It was a kickass [DBZ](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_(manga)>) fan website with background music, cursor animations and everything. Unfortunately that site is now lost in time.

I'll try to keep this site relatively clean of flashy animations.

On second thought, perhaps we should just bring all that back to the internet and in return get rid of [privacy zuckering](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-social-media-privacy-dark-patterns/) or [endless interruptions](https://www.deceptive.design/types/nagging).
