I'm Kristian, a fledgling programmer, computer science student, human-computer interaction & open-source enthustiast, and a dad.

This site serves two purposes. Tinkering with it is a nice hobby, and it allows me to post stuff related to my interests somewhere.

One of my biggest regrets in life is losing the [DBZ](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_(manga)>) fan website I created as a kid. It had background music, cursor animations and everything. Well, I'll try to keep this site more mature.
