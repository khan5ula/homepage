## Hi, I'm Kristian

... a fledgling programmer, student in information processing science, enthustiast in Open-Source Software, and a dad.

I tinker with this website as a hobby, and post about stuff related to my interests.

I got interested in coding in my 20's and I've been writing a little bit of code almost daily ever since. One especially fun aspect of learning is actually figuring something out in a way that it can be explained to others. Thus, I like to help others figure out things about programming whenever I get a chance. If I learn something fun, I'll probably post about it in my blog.

I was one of those kids who rushed back home from school to loiter around the internet. One of my biggest regrets in life is losing the [DBZ](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_(manga)>) fan website I created as back then. It had background music, cursor animations and everything. It would be nice to host it somewhere to remind me of fun times. Oh well...
